Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my proficiency in SQL and Power BI!

In this project, I harnessed the 'Pizza Sales' database to delve into key performance indicators (KPIs) of a pizza company. Using MS SQL, I analyzed vital metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, total number of orders and average number of pizzas per order. 

To visually represent these insights, I used Power BI to create interactive charts unveiling daily and monthly sales trends, pizza sales by category and pizza size. 

The first dashboard provides a comprehensive overview, while the second highlights the top 5 best and worst sellers based on revenue, quantity and total orders. 

This portfolio is meant to demonstrate my abilities to transform raw data into actionable business insights.
